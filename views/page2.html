    <h2>THE THREAT OF AI TO SECURITY</h2>
    <p>Privacy concerns


        The use of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to train AI models has given privacy and security professional a reasonable cause for concern. By incorporating PII into the training process, developers risk creating models that inadvertently reveal sensitive information about individuals or groups. As AI models become more powerful and adaptable, they might also learn to extract sensitive information from users in the course of conversations. A failure to sufficiently protect PII could lead to privacy breaches, scams, phishing and other social engineering attacks.



        To mitigate these risks, consider a range of factors and potential issues in AI technology:





        1. Loss of sensitive information


        One of the most pressing concerns is the potential exposure of sensitive information that end users enter in conversational AI systems. While this information may seem harmless on its own, it can be combined with other data points to create detailed profiles of individuals, potentially jeopardizing their privacy.





        2. Model explainability

        Many advanced AI models are so complex that even their developers might see them as “black boxes.” That makes it challenging for organizations to explain the models and their results to regulators. In heavily regulated industries like finance and healthcare, regulators often require clear explanations of a model’s outputs and decisioning processes. A lack of explainability can lead to undiagnosed errors and unidentified process improvements, along with more serious issues like undetected biases and ethical implications. It also obscures who or what is responsible when things go wrong. Some of these risks can be mitigated by adopting ethical AI development principles, promoting transparency, and improving user awareness and vigilance. However, mitigations must continue to evolve as AI use continues to expand in scale and complexity.





        3. Data sharing and third-party access

        AI platforms can involve collaboration between multiple parties, or use third-party tools and services. This increases the risk of unauthorized access or misuse of personal data, especially when data is shared across jurisdictions with different privacy regulations.





        4. Data retention and deletion

        Some AI solutions store data for extended periods so that they can continue referencing, analyzing and comparing it as part of informing their machine learning, predictive and other capabilities. This long-term data storage increases the risk of unauthorized access or misuse. The context and complexity of AI solutions can also make it challenging to ensure that data is deleted when it is no longer needed or when individuals exercise their rights to request deletion.
